Item Input


Item Display
Items in the container are displayed in a table. The items can be sorted by clicking the table headers.

There is a button on the top right of the table with a '+' sign which will show entry boxes to define an item.
All entry boxes must be filled, otherwise the entry will be rejected and a warning popup will appear.

At the far right of each row there is a button with a '-' sign which will remove the item specified by that row.
A popup message will appear, to confirm the delete action.
