USER INTERFACE
Items in the container are displayed in a table in the centre of the screen. 

There is a button on the top right of the table labeled "Add Item" which will show entry boxes to define an item.
After filling in all the entry boxes, press the Submit button to enter the item into the database.
If the entry is not acceptable, an error message will appear. 
Reasons why an item can be rejected include:
-Invalid Size (not enough space available, negative value)
-Invalid Cost (negative value)
-Unfilled entry

At the far right of each row there is a button labeled 'Delete Item' which will remove the item specified by that row.
A popup message will appear to confirm the delete action. A delete action will only be rejected if the object no longer exists.

At the bottom right, below the item table, is a smaller table detailing the total number of items in the table, total size of items in the table, 
percent of total capacity filled, and cost of items in the table.
